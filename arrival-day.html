                        The first day
                    </h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                When you arrive home for the first time with your puppy, you should take them straight
                                to your garden or outside side space. Let them explore for a little while and go to the
                                toilet if they need to. If you have other pets, it is essential to have them greet here
                                to as it helps to avoid territorial disputes.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Introduce your puppy to their crate. If you gave a blanket to the breeder or they gave
                                you any toys, put them in the crate to help your puppy identify it as their very own
                                safe space.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Feed the puppy. Try to keep the meal times and food the consistent with their schedule
                                with the breeder. This will help calm the puppy and ease them into their new way of
                                livig.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Play with your puppy and give them lots of attention but remember that puppies need lots
                                of rest and can sleep for up to 18 hours a day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Shower them with praise everytime they do anything good especially when they go to the
                                toilet in the right place. They'll learn what's right and wrong in no time.
                            </li>
                            <li>Avoid walking them at first. It's highly likely that they will not have their complete
                                set of jabs and so will need to see the vet first.

                            <li>
                                Choose a bed time and stick to it. Routine is what's going to help both you and your
                                puppy settle into a new life together</li>
                            <li>
                                Choose where they are going to sleep. Remember it will be distressing for the dog to be
                                allowed to sleep on your bed for 3 months only to change your mind later.</li>
                            <li>
                                Create a going to bed routine. This can involve doing a certain activity or giving a
                                certain type of food. A few slices of apple before bedtime can be a good indicator it is
                                time to sleep.</li>
                            <li>
                                Spend the first night sleeping in the same room if possible. It is likely they will cry
                                for most of the night and you should comfort and reassure them. Overtime you can teach
                                them there is nothing to fear but at the beginning a hard approach will only make them
                                feel more alone.
                            </li>
                            <li>Little puppies have little bladders and so will need to be taken out in the night, often
                                multiple times. This will get better in time!</li>
