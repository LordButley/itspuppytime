# Itâ€™s Puppy Time

"It's Puppy Time" is a one-stop shop for all your puppy orientated questions. It is an information website targetted at prospective and new puppy parents. It aims to make welcoming a puppy into the family easy by providing answers to queries and concerns regarding what to do and what to expect. As a relatively new puppy owner myself, I found that although all the information regarding puppy care is online, it is dispersed through-out. Thus my recent experiences and my puppy Pickle became the inspiration behind the creation of an easy to use website dedicated to puppy care.

## Structure

As the website is going to be heavy in information and text, it is therefore important to devide it into key sections across a number of pages. This is so that users do not feel overwhelmed by the text volume and can find the information they want easily.

The section idea was to divide into before getting a puppy, on the day you get a puppy, and after with a homepage. This lead to the following sections:

Home Page: This sets the tone for the whole website in terms of style. Simple to navigate and helps users move to the section of the website they want.

Preparation: Contains information regarding what to what to do before getting a puppy as well as what to buy

Puppy Arrival: Contains information regarding how to care for a puppy on the first day you get it as well as the first night.

Next Steps: Contains information regarding what to do with a puppy in the weeks and months after getting it

Contact us: Gives users opportunity to provide feedback on the website or tell us their own experiences of getting a puppy.

## Skeleton

The initial ideas were taken from the structure planning and a visual mock up was created using Balsamiq. Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes are all available [here.](wireframes/wireframes.pdf)

## Surface

### Colour Palette

The main colours for the website are a dark green and a light golden yellow. These are colours you would find if you take your dog for walks in any countryside or woodland. I wanted the the colour scheme to help emphasise that getting a puppy is a fun and happy experience but it is also one which must be taken seriously.

- The dark green (#25311d) was chosen as the main background colour as it gives the website a natural earthy feeling. It also gives the website a slightly more luxious and serious feel.  

- The golden yellow (#d3b86e) was chosen for the text as it gives a youthful happiness feel through-out. 

Both of these colours were picked from the hero image for additional consistency using https://imagecolorpicker.com/.

### Typography

I chose font Hachi Maru Pop for all titles. This is an informal and cute handwritten font that works well at larger sizes. It was chosen to represent the fun and playfulness of puppies.

Using Googlefont popular pairings, I found Poppins. This was chosen as it works well with Hachi Maru Pop but has also looks more serious and is easier to read blocks of text.

### Language / Tone

The tone through-out is designed to be fun but concise. The information is given in the imperative tone as it is all important. However fun and casual use of language is chosen to keep with the overall feeling of the website. 

### Imagery

The pre-requisite for all images is that they needed to be of puppies! Once this key condition was met, the background colours in the photo needed to be earthy tones or light natural tones. This was to ensure consistency throughout.
