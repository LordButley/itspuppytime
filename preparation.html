                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Purchase the items in the shopping list below. It's best to have too much than too
                                little.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Puppy proof your home. Remove any toxic plants and hide away any cables or other
                                dangerous items a puppy with brand new teeth could chew. Also remove any small items
                                they could swallow.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Set up your puppies sleeping area. If you are using a crate, consider covering all but
                                one side with a sheet to give it more of a den feel creating a safe space for your new
                                family member. Add lots of cushions and blankets inside to make it extra comfy
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Choose a reputable veterinary practice near you and book a first appointment. Remember
                                to bring with you the certificate of purchase and breeder documents as you will be asked
                                for these by the vet.
                            <li>
                                Secure your garden. Make sure that there are no places your dog can escape is left
                                unsupervised.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Check the route from the breeder to your home and work out where you will stop for
                                toilet breaks along the way.
                            </li>
                            <li>Set the ground rules such as where the dog will be allowed to go, and whether they will
                                be allowed on the sofa.</li>
                            <li>Get a good night sleep; there’s a good chance you won’t get much sleep the first night
                                you have the puppy. </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Crate</b> - – A crate or cage provides a den where your new puppy will feel safe as they
                            have their own space. It can also be useful moving forward as a training aide. You can cover
                            all but one side in a sheet to make it cosier.</li>
                        <li>

                        <li>
                            <b>Collar and name tag</b> - Your puppy will grow out of their collar multiple times as they
                            grow up so keep an eye on the tightness. A name tag with your details is a must in case they
                            get lost. </li>
                        <li>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Food</b> - It’s important that a puppy’s food intake is consistent. A good thing to do is
                            check what they have been fed already and consider continuing the same diet.
                        </li>

                            <b>Dog Shampoo</b> </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Toys</b> - Very quickly, your puppy will grow its first teeth, and will want to test out
                            how to use them. Keep them occupied with lots, and I mean lots, of different toys. Your
                            furniture will be grateful.
