    Live site was tested by checking all links across four screen widths.

 ## Lighthouse

When an initial Lighthouse audit was completed on all pages, scores of around 75 were given for performance. This was due to the images through-out the website. Consequently I re-sized all images and the average score for performance was raised to 99.

The scores on the initial audit for best practices were 93 on every page. This was due to an absolute file path being given to one of the four favicon links in the head element. Once changed to a relative file path, each page's score best practice score raised to 100.

After the two above bugs were fixed the average (across all pages) Lighthouse ratings were as follows:
